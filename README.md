# Coursera R Mentoring
_Mentoring records and my helping articles on Coursera (Under construction) (Last update: May 30, 2017)_

Some questions have been raised repeatedly in the Coursera R Programming course forum. Here I organized some of those questions and collected my replies to them.

## Getting Started
* [use "=" or "<-"](use_=_or_<-.md): Using either `<-` or `=` to assign values in R is a question related to personal preferences. I shared my own opinions here.
* [strptime returns NAs](strptime_returns_NA.md): Languages from different system locales may cause some abnormalities. However we can change the locale settings within R scope without changing the whole OS.

## Data preprocessing
* [factor levels and labels](factor_levels_and_labels.md): Categorical data are called "factor" in R. This article explains what are factor levels and factor labels respectively.
* [split data](split_data.md): Data can be splited with specified categories. However the length of the factor variables matters.
