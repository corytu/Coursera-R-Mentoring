Let's take an easy example to show the mechanisms. Consider the situation that only one vector is given.
```r
set.seed(1)
rate <- sample(10, 5)
rate
# 3 4 5 7 2
order(rate)
# 5 1 2 3 4
rank(rate)
# 2 3 4 5 1
```

Now, what _order_ gives you is, in this example, that "__the _5th_ element of rate is the smallest one__", so you have 5 coming in the first. Thus, for order function, you can do something like this:
```r
rate[order(rate)]
# 2 3 4 5 7
# Permute "rate" in ascending order
```

On the other hand, _rank_ gives you that "__the rank of the last element among rate elements is the _1st___", so the 5th returned value is 1.

Note that only _order_ accept multiple vectors as input arguments.

I know it takes some time to digest. Take it easy and feel free to ask further questions. :)
